# Table-tiling
This project computes spectra for iterations of hamiltonians generated by the substitution corresponding to the table tiling.

The functions used are:
    Suffix : associates an apropriate suffix to a number.
    print_mat : prints 2d array in a more pleasing manner
    BuiltTile : Generates the num-th iteration of the table tiling patch according to initial patch
    phase : Converts a float array of length 2 to complex array of length 2
    Op_Mat_NoPhase : Generates the Schroedinger operator into a square matrix without the phase contribution
    Op_Mat_Phase : Generates the phase contribution Schroedinger operator into a square matrix
    SubDiag : assign diagonal values to OpMat based on the tiling
    sample_numth_eig_new : a sampling code over equally distributed points on the torus
    index_to_loc : translated index in array to location on the x-y plane and returns string
    print_band : print graph of spectral bands given matrix of maxima and minima
    print_tot_band : prints spectrums for multiple subsequent iterations
    SubColor : assign colors to tile types based on the number
    check_input: auxillary function to test different stages of code
